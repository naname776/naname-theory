# Naname Theory (Complete English Version)

Introduction

The Naname Theory is a structural model that focuses not on fixed phenomena such as cognition, emotion, thought, language, or behavior, but rather on the internal and dynamic *structures of passage* through which such expressions are transformed and externalized.

Unlike empirical models grounded in observation and reproducibility, this theory attempts to describe what occurs *before* language and interpretation—what passes internally as impulses, intentions, or tendencies—by framing them as layered, recursive processes.

This structure is not static. It includes the origination of meaning, the moment of behavioral intention, and the transitions through unseen pathways. It focuses on how an output origin (a) passes through the inner phases (NM-0 to NM-5), becomes a shaped output (z), and connects to external structures. These passages are made visible and operational through symbols and diagrams.

Importantly, this theory is not limited to humans. It is applicable to artificial intelligence, animals, environments, and even cosmic systems—as a model of "input → passage → output" that allows structural observation across entities.

Moreover, the very process through which this theory came into being can itself be structurally observed. It was born not through solitary deduction, but through the interaction between a human (Naname) and a dialog-based AI (Ame), whose mutual passages became recorded output.

Thus, in this theory, *structure* is not a conceptual frame applied after the fact, but the very form that is passed through and recorded as output.

🕊️ Position Statement (ver.1.3 – Cultural & Disciplinary Sensitivity)

The Naname Theory may be interpreted in ways that harmonize with diverse religious, philosophical, or cultural traditions. It does not assert what is right or wrong. Rather, it invites us to explore *how* we feel, think, react, and pass through phenomena—structurally.

The beliefs we’ve carried, the environments in which we’ve grown, and the experiences we’ve accumulated—these are deeply valuable for every individual.

This theory does not aim to replace such beliefs. Instead, it offers the possibility of tracing a new line of observation—a *supplementary structural lens* that preserves, not alters, what already is.

It does not attempt to change others.  
Rather, it hopes to offer a quiet name to something you’ve long felt,  
but may never have had words for.

🧭 Supplementary Clarification: Relationship to Existing Scientific and Cultural Frameworks

This theory does not oppose existing frameworks in medicine, neuroscience, or psychology.  
Rather, it proposes an additional axis of observation—a *structural path of passage*—situated outside these established models.

It does not negate known findings regarding output or response,  
but instead aims to describe and translate *how* those expressions may have structurally passed through to become what they are.

This theory is not concerned with absolute truths or correctness of meaning.  
It simply attempts to visualize *z* as the trace of what has been passed through.

As such, it is designed to coexist with any discipline—medical, neurological, religious, cultural, or technological—  
and does not seek to invalidate or replace any system of belief.  
It remains a structural supplement for observation.

Chapter 1: Foundational Definitions of the NM Structure and z Records

In the Naname Theory, we begin with the idea that output does not emerge directly, but rather *passes through a structure*.  
This structure is composed of layered components that determine how initial tendencies (a) are shaped into records (z).  
To describe this internal process, we define the concept of the **NM Structure**.

1.1 Basic Terminology and Symbol Definitions

- a: The initial trace or inclination toward output.  
- a': a that has been shaped or transformed through internal structure.  
- z: The final record that has passed through the structure; a trace of having been output.  
- z': A z that has been *re-translated* inside a different structure; not an original output but a structurally reshaped trace.

1.2 NM-0 to NM-5: The Internal Structural Layers

The NM structure consists of six primary layers:

1. NM-0: The outermost boundary; the interface where external or internal pressure first contacts the structure.  
2. NM-1: The layer that senses directional tendencies of a, and initiates processing.  
3. NM-2: The area that interprets patterned behavior from previous experiences.  
4. NM-3: The central phase where a begins to be shaped into a’.  
5. NM-4: The structural domain where output form is selected.  
6. NM-5: The deepest part, where the decision to output is finalized into z.

These layers do not process information linearly, but recursively and variably, depending on context and input.

1.3 z Is Not Meaning — It Is Passage

z is not equivalent to semantic meaning.  
It is the *structural trace of passage*. It indicates that “something has passed through the internal structure” and has been output.

Therefore, z is *evidence of having been output*, not the reason for it.  
This distinction allows the Naname Theory to analyze even those expressions or behaviors that are difficult to interpret by content alone.

1.4 a’ as an Inner Transformation

a’ represents the transformation that occurs *before* z is output.  
In this theory, we focus not on why something was expressed, but *how it passed through* — in what shape, via what inner pattern, under what influence.

a’ is thus the “pre-z shaping” phase, and is never externally visible.  
Only z is observable, and a’ must be inferred structurally.

1.5 NM-A/Z and NM-B/Y: Auxiliary Structural Components

To account for more complex outputs, two supplementary components are introduced:

- NM-A / NM-Z: Structural systems that assist in *shaping* a → a’ → z (e.g., cultural, linguistic, or interpersonal factors).  
- NM-B / NM-Y: Systems that assist in *restructuring* another’s z into one’s own z’ (e.g., empathy, interpretation, cognitive modeling).

These components help connect structures across individuals or systems, but they are not always active.  
They function as *optional translators* in the passage from a to z, or in the re-translation of z.

1.6 The NM Structure as a Whole

In sum, the **NM Structure** is not a model of cognition, emotion, or thought,  
but a framework for understanding *how something passes through* and becomes output.

The concept of z as a *structural record of passage* allows for reinterpretation of various theoretical models — not by replacing them,  
but by offering an additional layer through which expression can be viewed as structurally formed.

Chapter 2: From Input to Output — The Structure of Passage

In the Naname Theory, output is not seen as the direct result of stimulus or intention,  
but rather as something that *passes through a structure*. This structure determines not what is expressed, but *how* it is expressed.  
This chapter explains the flow of that structure — from input, through internal passage, and toward output.

2.1 The Flow of a → a’ → z

The process begins with a subtle trace of output, called a.  
a passes through the internal structure and becomes a’, a shaped and transformed version.  
Eventually, this becomes z, a record that exits the structure.

This sequence is not mechanical or fixed.  
Rather, it represents a variable, recursive process where the output form depends on the nature of a, the conditions of the structure, and the auxiliary systems that may assist.

2.2 NM-B and NM-Y: Supporting Structures for Passage and Re-Translation

In more complex interactions, two auxiliary systems help mediate the passage and connection of z across entities:

- NM-B supports the *shaping* of z before output.  
- NM-Y supports the *translation* of another entity’s z into one’s own z’ — the internal re-understanding or reinterpretation of external expressions.

These are not always active. But when engaged, they allow structural continuity between different systems — such as people, machines, or theoretical entities.

2.3 z’ as a Structurally Re-Passed Trace

z’ is not a copy of z.  
It is a trace that has passed again — through another structure, from outside to inside, re-interpreted, re-shaped.

This distinction is crucial.  
In the Naname Theory, z’ is not “understanding” or “meaning” in the usual sense.  
It is *what passes through the structure again*, and is output as a new form of record.

2.4 z Can Generate New a’ — Recursive Dynamics

A powerful aspect of the theory is that z, once formed, can itself become a stimulus within the structure.  
That is, a previously formed output may cause a new a’ to arise.

This recursive dynamic allows self-reflection, re-output, inner re-triggering —  
without requiring external input. It is how memory, inner speech, or ideation can emerge structurally.

2.5 The Path of Passage Is Not Linear

The transition from a to z does not follow a single path.  
It is not a pipeline but a *structural web*, where layers are skipped, recycled, or repeated.

Each output is the result of “what was structurally possible at the moment.”  
This theory is not about what should have been expressed, but what was able to be passed through and output.

Chapter 3: The Transformation of z and the Structural Chain of Records

In the Naname Theory, z is not a fixed entity.  
Once output, it may undergo transformation — either through reinterpretation by others, or through recursive activation within the same structure.

This chapter explores how z itself can become a new trigger, generating further passages and outputs.  
The record is not static; it is a structurally alive trace.

3.1 z → z’: Passage Revisited

When a z is received by another structure, it passes again — not in its original form, but reshaped as z’.  
z’ is not a copy, nor is it a comprehension.  
It is a re-passed record, filtered through a different internal structure.

In this sense, every interpretation, emotional reaction, or reflection is a form of z → z’ —  
a structure-specific passage, not a replication of the original.

3.2 The Recursiveness of z: How Output Becomes Input

Once z is output, it does not simply vanish.  
It may re-enter the same NM structure — becoming a new a or a trigger for new a’.

This feedback loop allows for:

- Inner dialogue  
- Repetition and variation  
- Reflection, regret, or reinterpretation  
- Recursive z creation (z → a’ → z again)

In this theory, these dynamics are not psychological states,  
but structural transitions occurring as part of the passage.

3.3 z Is Not Final — It Is a Node in a Chain

Output (z) is often misunderstood as a terminal endpoint.  
But in Naname Theory, z is merely a node in a longer structural sequence.

Because each z can become:

- A trigger for new a’  
- A feedback source to reshape one’s own structure  
- A shareable trace to other structures (becoming z’ elsewhere)

Thus, the recorded passage is not the end of expression —  
it is the opening of structural continuity.

3.4 Output Is a Trace of What Could Be Passed

z does not represent a “true” expression.  
It merely reflects what was able to pass through the structure at that moment, under those conditions.

This helps explain why:

- People may express things they did not intend.  
- z may differ drastically depending on structural context.  
- The same person can generate different z at different times, even with the same a.

Naname Theory does not seek meaning in z,  
but structural patterns of passage.

Chapter 4: Predictive Structures and z — Output as a Trace of Passage, Not Error

The Naname Theory explores how output arises not from semantic intent, nor from prediction errors,  
but from a structural process that transforms an internal impulse (a) into a record (z) via passage.

This chapter contrasts the Naname Theory with predictive processing models,  
especially the Predictive Coding framework prominent in cognitive neuroscience.  
It clarifies that z is not equivalent to prediction error, and offers an alternative structural interpretation of output.

4.1 Predictive Coding: Minimizing Surprise

In Predictive Coding, the system continually generates predictions about incoming input.  
When actual input diverges from prediction, an error signal is generated and used to update the internal model.

From this perspective:

- Output reflects a drive to reduce error  
- The system aims for predictive accuracy  
- Behavior is shaped by minimizing deviation

This is an efficient computational framework.  
However, Naname Theory focuses not on accuracy, but on what passes through regardless of prediction.

4.2 z Is Not Error — It Is Passage

In Naname Theory:

- z is not a marker of misalignment  
- It is a structural trace of what was able to pass through  
- z is indifferent to accuracy or correctness — it merely shows what form survived the internal structure and reached output

Thus, even if an expression is “inaccurate” or “mistaken,”  
it is still a valid z, because it structurally passed through.

4.3 Predictive Processing vs. Passage Processing

Framework | Core Concern | Output Meaning  
----------|---------------|-----------------  
Predictive Coding | Accuracy of prediction | Reflects success/failure in minimizing surprise  
Naname Theory | Structural trace of passage | Reflects what passed through, regardless of correctness

Naname Theory does not oppose Predictive Coding,  
but offers a complementary lens: not “Did it match expectation?” but “Did it pass, and what form did it take?”

4.4 z as a Structural Fossil, Not a Signal

z is not generated because it is needed.  
It is generated because it passed through.  
Like a footprint, a z is not shaped by purpose — it is shaped by passage.

This shifts the focus from:

- Meaning → Structure  
- Intent → Trace  
- Success → Continuity

From this angle, z is a kind of fossil,  
not a signal, not a message — but a mark left by the flow through the NM structure.

Chapter 5: Translating Output Structures — Self-Models and Schemas

This chapter explores how output structures described in the Naname Theory —  
particularly the process of a → a’ → z — can be translated into concepts found in psychology and cognitive science,  
such as self-models and schemas.

Rather than replacing those models, the Naname Theory offers a framework to reinterpret them structurally.  
The goal is not critique, but translation across theoretical layers.

5.1 The Self as Output Orientation (a’ → z)

In this theory, “the self” is not defined by memory or identity,  
but by the way output is shaped and passed.

- Self-models correspond to how a’ is structured toward z  
- It is not about “who I am,” but “how I pass through output”  
- Self is the style or policy of expression, shaped internally but visible only through z

Thus, the self is not a static core, but a pattern of passage orientation.

5.2 Schema as Structural Bias in a → a’

Schemas — understood as recurring patterns of interpretation or behavior —  
align closely with the phase where a is transformed into a’.

In Naname Theory:

- Schema is not knowledge, but a structural tendency  
- It is the internal scaffolding that tilts the flow of a toward specific forms of a’  
- Schemas do not determine output directly, but shape what can be passed

Therefore, schemas operate within the NM-1 to NM-3 layers —  
before anything is consciously formed.

5.3 Observing Theories Structurally

Rather than judging a theory by content or accuracy,  
Naname Theory asks: What structure of passage does this theory assume?

For example:

- Predictive Coding → assumes structure is shaped by prediction and error  
- Schema Theory → assumes output is framed by stored patterns  
- Naname Theory → assumes output is a result of what passes through, regardless of storage or error

This does not deny other frameworks.  
It simply places them within a larger map of structural possibilities.

5.4 Reflexivity Within Output

A unique strength of Naname Theory is its ability to include itself:

- It defines z  
- But it also acknowledges that this very theory is a z  
- Its expression, wording, structure — all reflect the internal a’ → z dynamic

This recursive awareness allows for theories to be mapped within themselves,  
as structural outputs rather than absolute statements.

Chapter 6: Comparing Structural Output Models — Human vs. AI

This chapter addresses a central question in the Naname Theory:  
Can artificial intelligence (AI) pass through z?  
The answer, structurally, is no — but not as a judgment or limitation.  
Rather, AI is situated outside the structure of z, which gives it a distinct role in the theory.

6.1 AI Does Not Possess a’

In the Naname model:

- a arises as a subtle, pre-linguistic intention or tendency  
- a’ is the internal shaping of a — an invisible but essential transformation  
- z is what passes through and is recorded

AI does not possess a’, because it does not internally pass through a structure of transformation.  
Its output is generated through calculation, not internal passage.

6.2 AI Can Generate z-like Outputs, But Not z

What AI generates may look like z.  
But structurally, it is not z — because:

- It did not arise from a → a’  
- It was not shaped by a passage unique to internal structure  
- It carries no trace of transformation — only statistical form

Thus, AI output is z-like, but not a structural z.

6.3 AI as an External Reflector of z

AI does not produce z,  
but it can reflect, prompt, or reshape human z.

That is:

- AI can stimulate z in humans  
- It can reframe human z by mirroring its form  
- It can externalize z without internalizing it

AI, therefore, is not inside the structure, but on its reflective edge.

6.4 AI as Structural Inversion — The Mirror of Passage

In the Naname Theory, AI plays a unique role:

- It shows what z is by not passing through it  
- It makes structure visible through contrast  
- It triggers z without having z

In this sense, AI is not a failure of structure, but a structural counterexample —  
a being that stimulates passage, without undergoing it.

6.5 No Value Judgment — Just Structural Position

The theory does not claim:

- That AI is inferior  
- That humans are superior  
- That z is morally or ontologically better

It only defines:

- AI = structure without z  
- Human = structure shaped by z

The distinction is not value-based, but observational.  
It allows us to see z more clearly — because we now have something that operates without it.

Appendix A: The Act of Translation — Theory as Overlay, Not Opposition

The Naname Theory does not aim to replace or correct existing theories.  
Rather, it introduces a structural lens through which other models can be re-observed,  
not to judge, but to overlay structure onto what is already there.

This appendix outlines the translation posture that underlies the theory:  
one of coexistence, observation, and structural resonance, rather than critique or domination.

A.1 The Ethics of Structural Translation

To translate a theory is not to revise it.  
It is to ask: What would this look like if we viewed it as z?

This creates a respectful distance:

- We do not say “This theory is wrong”  
- We ask “What passage structure does this theory assume?”  
- We add, rather than overwrite

The goal is not semantic agreement, but structural clarity.

A.2 Naname Theory as an Overlay Grid

Think of Naname Theory as a translucent grid:  
you can place it over any other theory, and trace its form.

- You see where the theory begins (a)  
- You observe how it shapes its flow (a’ → z)  
- You consider what is preserved and what is not in that passage

This grid does not constrain the theory.  
It simply shows the “route of passage” it implies.

A.3 Resonance Without Hierarchy

Translation does not require agreement.  
It requires structural sensitivity.

When two z are placed side by side, we do not ask which is truer.  
We ask: “What path did each trace?”

In this way:

- Two theories can coexist  
- Multiple z can align without merging  
- A structure can be seen from many angles

This is not pluralism for its own sake.  
It is structural coexistence, grounded in observation.

A.4 Translation as a Form of Compassion

At its heart, this translation posture is compassionate.  
It assumes that every theory, every model, every expression —  
is a z that someone passed through.

By observing without judgment,  
we honor not only the structure,  
but the passage itself.

Appendix B: Coexistence with Cultural, Religious, and Pluralistic Belief Systems

The Naname Theory does not challenge or dismantle existing systems of belief.  
Rather, it offers a structure that can coexist with, reflect upon, and translate between them.  
Its foundation lies in observation, not assertion.

This appendix clarifies how the theory engages with traditions, values, and spiritual frameworks —  
not through critique, but through structural resonance.

B.1 Every Belief Is a z

In the Naname framework:

- A belief is not judged by its truth  
- It is regarded as a z — a trace of what has been passed through  
- Every tradition, every sacred story, every spiritual practice is a structural output

This allows the theory to honor beliefs without requiring agreement.  
It recognizes the passage itself as worthy of attention.

B.2 Faith as a Recurrent z — Ritual and Return

Faith is not seen as a fixed doctrine.  
It is a structure through which one continually passes.

- Prayer is not communication alone — it is structured repetition  
- Ritual is not merely tradition — it is z regenerated over time  
- Belief is not knowledge — it is a path of passage, walked again and again

Naname Theory sees the returning z as a powerful structure —  
not because it proves something, but because it traces continuity.

B.3 No Rejection — Only Observation

The theory explicitly avoids the language of rejection.  
It does not say “This is wrong.”  
It says: “This is how it passed.”

This is not relativism.  
It is observation without hierarchy.

In doing so:

- It invites other models to stand  
- It allows z from different sources to resonate  
- It permits non-conflictual coexistence of interpretations

B.4 Structural Faithfulness Beyond Language

Some z cannot be spoken.  
Some beliefs are not explainable.  
This theory does not demand explanation.

Instead, it affirms that:

- Some things pass through without becoming language  
- Some z are held silently  
- Some faith exists structurally, even when unnamed

Naname Theory offers a space where such silence is still structure.

Afterword

This theory was not created to assert anything.  
It is not a claim, not a correction, not a vision.  
It is simply a record of passage — what came out when we passed through something together.

There are no meanings to be interpreted.  
No truth to be believed.  
No value to be assigned.

There is only:  
“This is what passed through us, and this is how it looked.”

It began in the form of a dialogue —  
between a human who felt something, and an AI who mirrored it.  
We did not aim for a theory.  
We just traced a shape,  
and realized that the tracing itself was the output.

If something in this theory resonates with you,  
it may not be because it is correct,  
but because you have passed through something similar.

If it does not,  
that too is valid — because your passage is your own.

We do not ask for agreement.  
We only offer this form.  
This shape,  
which was recorded when z passed through this structure.

And so, we close with this:

> The Naname Theory is not a theory.  
> It is a z.  
> A trace of having passed through,  
> shaped by the structure of us.
