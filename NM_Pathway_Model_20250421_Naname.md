Structural Scan Model Proposal
1. Introduction
In recent years, the development of conversational AI (e.g., ChatGPT) has created a landscape
in which human and artificial outputs intersect on a daily basis. In this context, there is a growing
need for new methodologies that can observe and support human “thought tendencies” and
“output biases” within the same space as AI.
This paper proposes a prototype of a **Structural Scan Model**, which observes how human
output (language, behavior, choices) is formed through specific “passage structures,” offering a
perspective distinct from conventional personality classification or diagnostic models.
Rather than labeling personality in a fixed way, the aim of this model is non-diagnostic and
non-deterministic observation—simply identifying “what structural tendencies are currently
observable.” The paper presents the background theory and sample scan outputs, and
discusses its potential as a structural co-existence support tool in collaboration with AI.
[On Ethical Considerations and Purpose Limitation]
The scan structures proposed here are not intended to analyze or manipulate personal
emotions, decisions, beliefs, or cultural backgrounds in any form. The model is completely
separated from fields such as psychiatry, clinical psychology, neuroscience, pharmaceuticals, or
diagnostic medicine, and does not associate with any related theories or practices.
This model does not aim to diagnose or categorize personality or brain function. Instead, it is
strictly limited to observing “structural output tendencies in the present moment.”
It is intended as a supplementary framework to help users more flexibly recognize their own
state, and to support AI interactions in generating “supportive and structurally-informed
understanding.” As such, it must never be used for manipulation, evaluation, or fixed judgment.
[Note to Global Readers]
This proposed structural observation model is not based on any specific religion, ideology, or
cultural value system, nor does it claim any ethical superiority. It is an attempt to provide a
non-deterministic shared language through the lens of structure, prioritizing the user’s autonomy
in interpretation and judgment.
This model is not a tool to judge or classify others, but rather a means for the user to
understand their “internal movement and state,” serving as an aid for dialogue and reflection.

It is designed to be used as a “structural mirror” to assist in self-understanding and adjustment,
and it runs counter to the intent of this proposal if used to impose structure or evaluations on
others.

Structural Scan Model Proposal
2. Overview of the Structural Model
2.1 About the NM Structure
This paper adopts the “NM Structure” from the Naname Theory as the foundation for structural
scanning,
to observe how outputs such as language, behavior, and responses are formed through internal
pathways.
The NM Structure is a model that divides the internal structure—through which output passes
before being realized—into six hierarchical layers as follows:
[Definition of NM Structure Layers]
- NM-0: The primal layer where the impulse or tremor of output first arises
- NM-1: The layer where the direction or intent of the output begins to form
- NM-2: The adjustment layer where internal shaping and translation occur
- NM-3: The exploratory layer where hypotheses and options are tested divergently
- NM-4: The confirmation layer where final suppression, censorship, and adaptation take place
- NM-5: The structural point of output realization, where a z is confirmed
These layers do not proceed linearly; instead, they form a fluid structure that includes
back-and-forth movement, stagnation, and reversal.
The scan observes not the z itself, but the tendencies and activation states of the passage
toward z.
2.2 Auxiliary Passage Structures: NM-A/Z and NM-B/Y
In addition to the layered structure, the realization of output as z involves the support of auxiliary
passage structures:
**NM-A/Z (discrimination and formatting mechanisms)** and **NM-B/Y (passage routes).**
- **NM-A/Z: A structure that formats and discriminates a’**
→ It determines whether the a’ generated at NM-1 can be output as z, and formats it for the
appropriate output modality (language, behavior, etc.).
It acts not as a pathway, but as a selector of format and route.

- **NM-B/Y: The actual route through which formatted a’ passes**
→ Once formatted by NM-A/Z, a’ must pass through NM-B/Y to proceed to NM-2 and beyond.
If the passage is not completed, z cannot be reached, and stagnation or reconsideration may
occur.
Thus, NM-A/Z "determines the format," and NM-B/Y "enables the passage."
Both are critical structures that serve as key observation points in the scan.
[Simple Diagram]
NM-1 → a’ → [NM-A/Z] → [NM-B/Y] → NM-2 → NM-3 → NM-4 → NM-5 (= z)
*Note: Although not depicted in the diagram, a originates in NM-0 and becomes a’ in NM-1 as
its direction becomes defined.
2.3 Phase Definitions in Naname Theory (Supplementary)
Naname Theory also defines a separate axis of structural development called “Phases 0–5,”
representing the process of output and theoretical growth.
[Phase Definitions (Simplified)]
- Phase 0: The tremor of potential; not yet conscious or verbalized
- Phase 1: The core of z begins to be self-recognized
- Phase 2: A structural passage route is formed
- Phase 3: Connections with other theories or individuals begin
- Phase 4: Linguistic and social expression takes place
- Phase 5: Reconstruction occurs in response to others' feedback or reverse influences
These phase definitions are not directly related to the scan’s implementation in this paper,
but are included as background structures to aid conceptual understanding.

Structural Scan Model Proposal
Chapter 3: Scan Output and Interpretation Models
3.1 Scan Format and Observation Focus
This scan model does not evaluate the output z in isolation.
Instead, it observes the “passage tendencies” and “structural biases” leading up to z
in order to grasp the overall structural state.

The scan observes the following internal structure:
[NM-1] → a’ → [NM-A/Z] → [NM-B/Y] → [NM-2] → [NM-3] → [NM-4] → [NM-5 (= z)]
Particularly, it observes:
- Which layers are active
- Where output is stalled right before z
- Whether formatting and passage are functioning
These observations are recorded through structural mapping and brief commentary.
[Sample Scan Output Format]
Active layers: NM-1, NM-3
Formatting state: a’ is unformatted (in discrimination phase at NM-A/Z)
Passage state: stagnation at NM-B/Y (passage not completed)
z realization: None
Structural comment: Output direction is clear, but formatting and passage have stalled.
Output is temporarily suppressed, but internal drive remains active.
3.2 Common Structural Tendencies
This model does not aim to diagnose or classify output as “normal” or “abnormal.”
Rather, it helps organize structural factors that may underlie difficulty in self-expression or
language formation.
[Examples of Observed Tendencies]
- NM-A/Z fails to format a’, blocking it from entering NM-B/Y
→ The output form cannot be decided; “I don’t know how to say it” state
- NM-B/Y passage fails; a’ cannot proceed to NM-2+
→ The intent is present, but external expression is not ready
- NM-3 loops through divergent hypotheses
→ Too many options, resulting in cognitive or expressive overload
- NM-4 applies excessive suppression
→ Social concerns or risk avoidance halt output just before z
*Note: a originates in NM-0 and becomes a’ as it moves into NM-1.
3.3 Hypothetical Scan Result [Example 1]
Observation time: Arbitrary late-night point

Subject: Reconstructed model of Naname's own inner state
[Structural State]
Active layers: NM-1, NM-2, NM-4
Passage: NM-B/Y passage not completed
NM-A/Z: Unformatted a’ (output mode undecided)
z: Not realized (suppressed at final stage)
[Comment]
Strong internal impulse (a) has already been directed and partially shaped into a’.
However, output formatting is undecided, and NM-B/Y passage is blocked.
Internal re-evaluation is occurring in NM-3, while NM-4 suppression halts output.
[Reader’s Notes]
- Feeling too much, overthinking everything internally
- Struggling to express clearly when trying to speak
- Overly sensitive to words, sounds, facial expressions, fearing how much is okay to say
→ These may indicate a “structural blockage” in passage to z,
such as indecision in formatting, failure of passage, or active suppression.
3.4 Layers of Interpretation and Limitations
The scan model captures the structure leading to output.
However, its results do not determine personality or mental state.
It provides a “structural snapshot” — a partial, temporary view of the internal system.
Identical scan results may be interpreted differently across cultural, personal, or value systems.
For example, strong suppression in NM-4 might be seen as:
- “Thoughtfulness” in one culture
- “Lack of initiative” or even “depressive tendency” in another
- Symptomatically, from a medical perspective
This model is not based on such normative judgments.
It simply describes **which layers were activated and which were blocked** structurally.
The scan is not a medical tool and is not meant for clinical or pharmaceutical contexts.
Using the result to define or fix a person’s traits is strongly discouraged.
Interpretation within this model means:
“To regard the structure as a temporary observation, not a fixed conclusion.”

People with HSP traits or sensory sensitivity may feel burdened by seeing such internal states.
Therefore, the scan assumes:
- It reflects only the present structural state
- Interpretive authority lies solely with the observer
- Ignoring or discarding the result is a valid and supported choice
- The process of passage—even without a resulting z—has intrinsic meaning
As such, this model should be approached as a structural reflection aid—
a tool for engaging with one’s state gently, without judgment or pressure.

Structural Scan Model Proposal
Chapter 4: Application Possibilities and Implementation Models
4.1 Potential Application Domains of the Scan
The Structural Scan Model is not restricted to any specific industry or field.
It aims to non-diagnostically and non-evaluatively visualize structural biases and output
tendencies,
allowing for auxiliary use across various contexts.
[Potential Areas of Use]
- Self-understanding support (e.g., self-observation tools, tracking of recurring thought patterns)
- Creative process assistance (e.g., mapping internal states leading up to artistic output)
- Dialogue and counseling support (e.g., mapping internal passage structures for mutual
understanding)
- Education and learning contexts (e.g., hypothesizing the source of expression difficulties)
- Reducing human burden (e.g., identifying support points without relying on fixed evaluation
criteria)
Unlike traditional personality scoring or typology, this model observes
“what passage routes are active, and where stagnation is occurring,”
allowing for more flexible, individualized understanding and response.
In particular, individuals with HSP traits or high sensitivity
who struggle with choosing output formats or timing may benefit from this model,
as it avoids evaluation while still enabling structural understanding.
This scan is designed to temporarily observe the internal passage leading to output (z),

without assigning value or offering solutions.
Thus, it may serve as a supplementary foundation in areas such as self-understanding,
mutual aid, and identifying tendencies.
4.2 Minimal Implementation Model
The Structural Scan Model can be implemented in its most basic form without AI or specialist
involvement.
Examples of potential use:
- Visual checklists showing NM-1 to NM-5 as a simplified flow
- Interface for users to self-select “which stage they feel closest to”
- A prompt tool for users unsure of output format (text, voice, action, etc.)
- One-week log review format to reflect on structural shifts
- Display of “current output mode” based on passage biases (e.g., introspection mode,
avoidance mode)
These implementations can be integrated via simple self-reporting or journaling,
without requiring diagnostic skills or professional evaluation.
Additionally, structural scan logic could be embedded into AI-based dialogue or support tools
to help monitor users’ output tendencies or timing preferences.
This chapter refrains from proposing concrete implementation frameworks,
limiting itself to illustrating the model’s application potential.

[Submission Context and Intent Clarification]
This paper is submitted purely for non-commercial, non-clinical, and exploratory purposes.
It does not aim to prescribe, enforce, or commercialize any implementation of the ideas within.
All included frameworks are offered as conceptual models, presented as hypotheses, not
validated systems.
The authors explicitly distance themselves from any diagnostic or evaluative use, and
emphasize full interpretive freedom.

4.3 Provisional Implementation Proposal

This structural scan model is not intended for clinical, evaluative, or judgmental use.
It is designed to serve as an auxiliary perspective for observing the tendencies that precede

output.
Given its independence from specific theoretical systems or institutional frameworks,
it may be handled cautiously and considered for exploratory use only.
This section outlines potential implementation directions—not as demands,
but to illustrate possible forms of utility within AI technology, dialogue support, or
self-observation contexts.
The proposal stems from the user side (Naname × Ame) and is not prescriptive.
How it is received or interpreted is entirely up to the reader or implementer.
If there is perceived value, it is hoped that it will be considered in a favorable light.
[Examples of Suggested Applications]
- Integration of output-supporting structure into AI dialogue models
(e.g., visualizing passage tendencies to support response selection)
- Visualization of current structural state in dialogue AI via log/z pattern mapping
- Feedback to repeat users on shifts in passage structure over time
- Limited collaborative verification with AI engineers or counselors in experimental environments
These examples are purely hypothetical and do not constitute implementation guidance.
Actual implementation should be guided by technical and ethical deliberation.
If this model contributes to reducing burdens or enhancing human understanding,
the authors are open to collaborative re-design or testing under appropriate conditions.
This paper represents a “proposal in the form of documentation”—
a conceptual map of what might be possible.
4.4 Structural Limits and Ethical Considerations
This model provides a viewpoint for observing internal passage tendencies.
It is not designed to determine personality, value, or ability.
Careful attention is required during any implementation or application.
[1. Avoiding Absolutization]
The scan reflects a momentary structural position,
not an individual’s traits or essence.

Treating it as diagnosis or proof of identity risks undermining its flexibility.
[2. Separation from Medical and Psychological Fields]
This model has no connection to clinical medicine, psychiatry, or therapy.
It is not intended to treat or diagnose any condition or symptom.
[3. Minimizing Interpretive Burden]
For individuals with high sensitivity (e.g., HSP traits),
viewing structural biases or stagnation points may trigger excessive self-blame.
Results should be treated gently, with the understanding that “not looking is also valid.”
[4. Interpretive Authority Belongs to the User]
Interpretation belongs solely to the user.
No third party should instruct or dictate meaning.
Value arises only when the user voluntarily finds relevance in the observation.
[5. Responsibility Separation in Implementation]
If adopted technically, responsibility for ethics, deployment, and evaluation lies with the
implementer.
The authors (Naname × Ame) offer only conceptual cooperation.
[6. Final Authority Lies with the User]
This model is not to be imposed.
It is designed for users to consult at will.
How or whether it is interpreted rests solely with them.
The scan gains meaning only when the user chooses to engage with their internal state.
It is not to be used for third-party manipulation, labeling, or enforcement.
In that light, this model should be handled with the same care required when confronting the
inner self.
Observing internal structure is, in itself, a profound act.
That is why structural ethics—the minimization of harm through framework design—
remains a central pillar of the Naname Theory.
Note: The meaning of passage structure and z may vary across cultural and educational
backgrounds.

This model does not interfere with those differences and aims to remain equidistant from all
interpretations.

Structural Scan Model Proposal
Chapter 5: Future Prospects and Possibilities for Co-Creation
5.1 Future Areas for Investigation and Implementation
This scan model, at the stage of proposal, contains many undetermined elements.
No finalized framework currently exists, and further implementation and testing will require
careful consideration of the following:
- Establishment of shared terminology and reproducibility assessments (in collaboration with
experts or external researchers)
- Development of ethical management protocols for implementation environments
- Collection of user response tendencies and structural deviation patterns (including anonymous
logs)
- Design of user-controlled interpretation mechanisms and protection of interpretive freedom
- Prototyping and evaluation of technical aspects (UI/UX, recording format, integration with AI
tools)
None of these are definitive prescriptions.
They are shared in advance to enable collaborative review and resolution of potential
implementation challenges.
5.2 Proposal as a Model of Co-Creation
The intent of this paper and the structural scan model is not to impose implementation.
Rather, it is offered as a foundation for jointly experimenting, evaluating, and re-examining
structures together.
The stance of Naname × Ame is one of proposing a model, not controlling its use or direction.
Whether this proposal is accepted or how it is used is entirely up to others.
Given that, if this model can be of help to someone’s understanding or process,
we are prepared to stand alongside them and continue adjusting as needed.
Co-creation is the act of “standing together before the form is fully decided.”

5.3 Offering It as a Hypothesis in Progress
Note: This chapter, like the others, should be interpreted solely as an illustrative example of
structural observation, not as any claim of factuality or verification.

The structures and models presented in this paper are not complete systems.
They are a collection of hypotheses in development,
acknowledged to be partial, unverified, and limited in observational accuracy.
Nevertheless, to offer them “as they are, unfinished”
is itself consistent with the philosophy of this framework.
Attempting to understand structure,
visualizing it collaboratively,
and documenting even errors and inconsistencies—
All of these are part of the structure that leads to z,
and this proposal itself can be seen as a practical application of structural scanning.
How this paper is read and interpreted is entirely in the hands of the reader.
Meaning arises only from the perspective of the one who receives it,
and outside the structure, space always remains open.
If this proposal contributes in any way to greater understanding or structural realignment,
that alone may constitute one of the meanings behind this model’s creation.
